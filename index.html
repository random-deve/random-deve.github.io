    <h1>Dear Changemaker,</h1>
    <p>From May 23rd to 25th, 2024 students at Munich International School will run a Solutionary Summit, which aims to inspire youth and to nurture students in developing solutions to local problems (like plastic or electronic waste). Around 150 external students from 20 schools will be attending and we would like to invite you to be one of them!<br><br>
      During the three days of the Summit, there will be a range of opportunities, including: listening to leaders sharing the positive change they have made, attending inspiring workshops of your choice and planning change you will initiate. Around 10 students from your school can attend with 1 to 2 supervisors. We will help you arrange your stay and/or transport from the hotel.<br><br>
      This Summit will be the second in a hopefully ongoing routine of student-centered thinking gatherings, following the very successful Changemakers Conference at Frankfurt International School in March 2023.<br><br>
      The theme of our Summit is Base 10 Changemakers. If you choose to attend, you (100) have taken the first step to create change. You will leave the Summit having collaborated with 101,102 or more other Changemakers - just like a flap of a butterfly's wings may cause a tornado of movement. <br><br>
      Please also feel free to contact us via kberkman@mis-munich.de with any other questions or suggestions.
      We are looking forward to your reply!
      <br> <br>
      Sincerely,
      Munich International School
    </p>
