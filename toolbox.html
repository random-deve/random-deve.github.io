     <h1>The Sustainability Compass</h1>
    <p>
      The compass is a tool developed for sustainability and systems thinking.
      It emphasizes interdependency and interdependence. We use this tool to
      understand how different topics and workshops can relate to these four
      different compass points and it gives us an idea of how the workshops
      fits into the grander scheme of the conference and changemakers in general.
      In addition, it is a common framework used and provides a shared language
      and terminology when discussing local and global issues, and more.

    Before digging into the issues that we care about, we must first
    build care and strength for our own self.

      a. What you currently do (so that you can identify the ways you're already living your values); <br>
