        Hi, my name is Justus, and I am currently in Grade 7.
        In 4th grade I studied bats for my PYP exhibition
        project as I used to have a fear of them! Now I am
        their biggest fan and have constructed and installed
        the first bat houses at MIS.  I have also hosted a Bat
        Night where we saw that our first bat has moved in !
        Also, this year my bat project was one of the two projects
        which resulted in the school receiving the Eco School Award.

      <p>
        Matovu Nkoba Ismael grew up in rural Uganda, where lack
        of clean water access was a major challenge. As a student,
        he initiated a well project providing safe water to 600
        households in his rural community. He later founded the
        tech startup Clawest to leverage AI for increased clean
        water access worldwide. Through collaborative efforts
        like the Finley, Nantume, Nkoba (FN&N) Well Project,
        Nkoba is making a profound impact by empowering rural
        and marginalized communities with clean water access.

      <p>
        Jennifer Brandsberg-Engelmann has been teaching Economics,
        Business Management and Environmental Systems and Societies
        for 26 years in three countries, mainly in the International
        Baccalaureate. She is an expert in developing and executing
        educational strategies, projects, processes and curricula.
        Her core focus is training young people to take action for
        sustainable and regenerative societies. She has worked with
        student changemakers in a school Sustainability Action Lab,
        developing their knowledge, skills and passions through a
        changemaking curriculum that she lead-developed with
        colleagues from other disciplines and other international
        schools. She has co-authored Economics, Business Management
        and Environmental Systems and Societies textbooks integrating
        new economic thinking and social enterprise themes into
        those works. Jennifer has also delivered webinars on
        sustainability and works to shift curricular systems
        to new paradigms to address 21st century problems.
        Most recently, she has been advocating for regenerative
        economics to replace current economics courses in secondary
        schools. This changemaking work is ongoing - you may see it
        in your school soon!

      <p>
        Julie Meltzer, Ph.D., is committed to creating schools
        that truly help students prepare to successfully meet
        their futures. She currently serves as the Director of
        K-12 and Teacher Education for the Institute for Humane
        Education, a nonprofit organization based in the United
        States. In that role, Julie leads a team that works with
        teachers and administrators across the United States
        and around the world to teach their students how to
        become changemakers. Julie believes that education
        is the system that can change all other systems and
        that redesigning schools to educate a generation of
        solutionaries is the single best investment we can
        make for our collective future.

        WHAT WE DO : <br>
        MAD (Make A Difference) Courses' partners with remarkable
        communities and changemakers around the world, giving
        them a voice and platform to tell their stories - which
        in turn inspires and educates students worldwide. By
        using interactive video technology, we immerse students
        in global issues and innovative solutions. We build
        curriculum around the stories we share to prompt greater
        reflection and empower students to take informed action. 
        <br> <br>
        WHAT WE DO WITH MIS : <br>
        MAD collaborates with Kathryn Berkman from Munich
        International School, whose students will use the course
        to develop concepts of identity, culture, and perspective.
        She says : "(Before this opportunity arose) I was teaching
        systems thinking tools on my own, without guidance or
        progression.” Now, she is “most excited” for her students
        to be part of a larger community of changemakers, and have
        the support of MAD courses as her students develop their
        projects.
