      <h1 class="names">Justus</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Justus, and I am currently in Grade 7. In 4th grade I studied bats for my PYP exhibition project as I used to have a fear of them! Now I am their biggest fan and have constructed and installed the first bat houses at MIS.  I have also hosted a Bat Night where we saw that our first bat has moved in !  Also, this year my bat project was one of the two projects which resulted in the school receiving the Eco School Award.</p>
