      <p>Hi, my name is Justus, and I am currently in Grade 7. In 4th grade I studied bats for my PYP exhibition project as I used to have a fear of them! Now I am their biggest fan and have constructed and installed the first bat houses at MIS.  I have also hosted a Bat Night where we saw that our first bat has moved in !  Also, this year my bat project was one of the two projects which resulted in the school receiving the Eco School Award.</p>

Matovu Nkoba Ismael grew up in rural Uganda, where lack of clean water access was a major challenge. As a student, he initiated a well project providing safe water to 600 households in his rural community. He later founded the tech startup Clawest to leverage AI for increased clean water access worldwide. Through collaborative efforts like the Finley, Nantume, Nkoba (FN&N) Well Project, Nkoba is making a profound impact by empowering rural and marginalized communities with clean water access.

In that role, Julie leads a team that works with teachers and administrators across the United States and around the world to teach their students how to become changemakers.

WHAT WE DO : 
 MAD (Make A Difference) Courses' partners with remarkable communities and changemakers around the world, giving them a voice and platform to tell their stories - which in turn inspires and educates students worldwide. By using interactive video technology, we immerse students in global issues and innovative solutions. We build curriculum around the stories we share to prompt greater reflection and empower students to take informed action. 

WHAT WE DO WITH MIS :
MAD collaborates with Kathryn Berkman from Munich International School, whose students will use the course to develop concepts of identity, culture, and perspective. She says : "(Before this opportunity arose) I was teaching systems thinking tools on my own, without guidance or progression.” Now, she is “most excited” for her students to be part of a larger community of changemakers, and have the support of MAD courses as her students develop their projects.
